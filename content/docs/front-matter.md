# Front Matter

## Specifying layouts

If a layout is not specified, it uses the layout in `default.html`. To specify a layout, you must put the following in your page's front matter:
````yaml
layout: mylayout
````
Replace `mylayout` with the file name of your layout (not including the `.html`).

## Variables

Common variables used in front matter are `title` and `description`. Of course, these are supported by Luxaura.js, and so are any custom variables you'd like to use!

## Calling the variables

See [Variables](/docs/variables) for more information.
