# Pug

Pug can also be used to access variables (but it can only be used in `.pug` files).

## Using Pug

### Calling site/page variables
See [Variables](/docs/variables) for more information on this.

### Including partials
If you'd like to include a partial, simply use the following script:
````pug
include ../partials/mypage.html
````
